        Hi! We are a group of recently graduated high school students named Jenny, Lavanya, and Rana. Having gone through the excruciating process of choosing a career path, setting career goals and picking the ideal university program, we realize how difficult
        it is to navigate through the wide range of career opportunities available. Therefore, weâ€™ve decided to create this career compatibility quiz to help other high schoolers going through the same process. We hope it helps :)
